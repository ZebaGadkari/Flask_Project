# Flask_Project
This repository contains a simple Data Management System implemented using Flask and SQLite.
The project consists of several HTML templates (covid, enter_adhar, home, result, viewdata) for user interfaces and a main Python file (Adhar1_info.py) responsible for managing the data.

The Adhar1_info.py file serves as the core of the project, handling database operations and interactions. It includes features for adding, retrieving, and displaying Aadhar card data. The HTML templates provide a user-friendly interface for data entry and presentation.

This project showcases the use of Flask, SQLite, and HTML to create a simple yet functional database-driven web application. The different components work together to demonstrate the principles of data storage and retrieval.
